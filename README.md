# üìß HamOrSpam

This project implements a binary text classification model to detect **spam** messages from SMS texts. It uses TensorFlow and Keras, with a text vectorization layer and a simple neural network.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The model is trained on a public SMS dataset with two classes: **ham** (not spam) and **spam**. It preprocesses text using TensorFlow's `TextVectorization` and trains a neural network with embedding, pooling, and dense layers.

## üìä Training Details

The model was trained for **10 epochs** with the following performance:
